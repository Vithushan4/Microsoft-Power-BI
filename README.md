# Analysis on Essential Cost of Living (CPI Index)
This dashboard was created to analyze and compare the average essential cost of living for both pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods. An analysis is provided on the movement of average costs in four of the CPI Index categories, along with key trends in these CPI Index categories. The dataset used for this analysis is the Consumer Price Index from Statistics Canada which has data from 2003 to 2023. The post-pandemic analysis will be solely based on data from the years 2020 to 2023. For the purpose of this analysis, the essential costs of living are to be defined as food, shelter, transportation, and energy. The CPI Index includes many different consumer costs; however, these four categories are areas of consumer costs that are necessary for survival.
