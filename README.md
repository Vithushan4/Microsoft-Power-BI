# FBIT Enrollment Trends at Ontario Tech University
This Power BI dashboard examines enrollment trends in the Faculty of Business and IT (FBIT) at Ontario Tech University from 2017 to 2022. The dataset was provided in the Advanced Business Intelligence course at Ontario Tech University.

The analysis focuses on three areas of FBIT enrollment: business majors, IT majors, and master’s programs. This dashboard incorporates custom visuals such as the Sankey and Chord diagrams. A key challenge was interpreting these visuals without filters, as the relationships were initially unclear. However, filtering revealed valuable insights.

Findings highlight programs with high enrollment but declining trends, as well as those with lower enrollment but increasing interest. Undergraduate programs were generally more popular than graduate programs. These insights can help FBIT administration refine curricula and develop targeted marketing strategies to boost enrollment where needed.
